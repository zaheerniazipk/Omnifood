<p><strong style="">1. Define your project</strong></p><ul style=""><li>Start off by defining the goal of your project. This can be showing your portfolio to the world, selling an e-book, building a blog, etc.</li><li>Also define your audience. Ask yourself: which is the typical user that will visit my website?</li><li>This is important, because you should always design with your goal and audience in mind.</li></ul><div style=""><br style=""></div><p><strong style="">2. Plan out everything</strong></p><ul style=""><li>Once your project is defined, plan your content carefully. This includes text, images, videos, icons, etc.</li><li>Remember what I told you about visual hierarchy. It plays an important role when you start thinking about what you want on your website and what you don&#039;t. Defining the content before actually starting the design is called the <em style="">content-first approach</em>. It means that you should design for the content, instead of designing a webpage and then filling it with some stuff.</li><li>Define the navigation.</li><li>Define the site structure. You can draw a sitemap in this step if we&#039;re talking about a bigger project.</li></ul><div style=""><br style=""></div><p><strong style="">3. Sketch your ideas before you design</strong></p><ul style=""><li>Now it&#039;s time to get inspired and think about your design.</li><li>Then, get the ideas out of your head. And with that I mean that you should sketch your ideas before you start designing. It will help you explore ideas and create a concept of what you want to build. Using pencil and paper is a great way of quickly retaining your valuable ideas.</li><li>Make as many sketches as you want, but don&#039;t spend too much time perfecting anything. Once you have an initial idea, you can concentrate on the details when designing in HTML and CSS.</li><li>I advise you to never, ever start designing without having an idea of what you want to build. Getting inspiration is very important in this phase, and I already told you how to do that!</li></ul><div style=""><br style=""></div><p><strong style="">4. Design and develop your website</strong></p><ul style=""><li>After sketching, start to design your website using all the guidelines and tips you&#039;ve learned in the web design section.</li><li>You&#039;ll do that using HTML and CSS, which is called <em style="">designing in the browser</em>. Designing in the browser is basically designing and developing at the same time.</li><li>There are more and more designers leaving traditional design programs such as Photoshop and start designing in the browser. The biggest reason for this is that you can&#039;t design responsive websites in photoshop. It also saves you tons of time.</li><li>In this phase, you&#039;ll use your sketches, content and planning decisions you&#039;ve made in steps 1, 2 and 3.</li></ul><div style=""><br style=""></div><p><strong style="">5. It&#039;s not done yet: optimization</strong></p><ul style=""><li>Before you can actually launch your beautiful masterpiece for the world to see it, we have to optimize its performance in terms of site speed.</li><li>You also need to do some basic search engine optimization (SEO) for search engines such as google.</li></ul><div style=""><br style=""></div><p><strong style="">6. Launch the masterpiece</strong></p><ul style=""><li>Your optimized website is now finally ready to launch.</li><li>All you need for launching is a webserver that will host your website and deliver it to the world.</li></ul><div style=""><br style=""></div><p><strong style="">7. Site maintenance</strong></p><ul style=""><li>The launch of your website is not the end of the story.</li><li>Now it&#039;s time to monitor your users&#039; behavior and make some changes to your website if necessary.</li><li>You should also update your content regularly in order to show your users that your website is alive!
